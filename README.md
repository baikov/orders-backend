## Features
- Custom User model
- Djoser registration
- Celery + Redis + Flower
- Sentry in prod
- Nginx for media in prod
- Silk profiling in dev

## Improvement plan

- [ ] add logging

## Local development

Choose one of `.env` presets.

> To use `Mode 1` and `Mode 2`, a raised container from [this repo](https://github.com/baikov/tpl-traefik) with Traefik is required. Because an external network to which frontend and backend containers are connected is created in Traefik compose.

### Mode 0: As separate dev server on custom port

1. No need for a Traefik container
1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
1. Set `uniqe` project name
    ```env
    COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=uniqe_name
    ```
1. Uncomment `Mode 0` block and set custom ports if needed:
    ```env
    # Mode 0: As separate dev server on custom port
    COMPOSE_FILE=local.yml
    DOMAIN=localhost
    DJANGO_DOCKER_PORT=8000
    MAILHOG_DOCKER_PORT=8025
    FLOWER_DOCKER_PORT=5555
    DOCS_DOCKER_PORT=9000
    ```
1. Run `docker compose build` and `docker compose up -d`

### Mode 1: As dev server behind the Traefik with http

> Avaliable paths: `dj-admin/`, `api/`, `ststic/`, `silk/`. Other paths are proxied to the frontend container

1. The Traefik container must be running in `Mode 1`
1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
1. Set the project name same as `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` in Traefik `.env`
    ```env
    COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=example
    ```
1. Uncomment `Mode 1` block:
    ```env
    # Mode 1: As dev server behind the Traefik with http
    # For Windows users: use `;` (semicolon) as separator - local.yml;local.traefik.yml
    COMPOSE_FILE=local.yml:local.traefik.yml
    DOMAIN=localhost  # or another aliace for 127.0.0.1 declared in etc/hosts, but same as DOMAIN in Traefik .env!
    ```
1. Run Traefik container, then run Django stack with `docker compose build` and `docker compose up -d`

### Mode 2: As dev server behind the Traefik + SSL and custom domain

> Avaliable paths: `dj-admin/`, `api/`, `ststic/`, `silk/`. Other paths are proxied to the frontend container

1. The Traefik container must be running in `Mode 2`
1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
1. Set the project name same as `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` in Traefik `.env`
    ```env
    COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=example
    ```
1. Uncomment `Mode 2` block:
    ```env
    # Mode 2: As dev server behind the Traefik + SSL and custom domain
    # For Windows users: use `;` (semicolon) as separator - local.yml;local.traefik.yml;local.traefik.ssl.yml
    COMPOSE_FILE=local.yml:local.traefik.yml:local.traefik.ssl.yml
    DOMAIN=tpl.local  # same as DOMAIN in Traefik .env!
    ```
1. Run Traefik container, then run Django stack with `docker compose build` and `docker compose up -d`

### Usefull commands from django-cookiecutter

1. Show Logs (e.g. Django)
    ```shell
    docker logs -f django
    # or
    docker compose logs -f django
    ```
1. Migrations
    ```shell
    docker compose run --rm django python manage.py makemigrations
    ```
    ```shell
    docker compose run --rm django python manage.py migrate
    ```
1. Django shell_plus with ipython
    ```shell
    docker compose run --rm --name django_shell django python manage.py shell_plus --ipython
    ```
1. Create DB backup (placed in `./pg-backups`)
    ```shell
    docker compose exec postgres backup
    ```
1. Show backups list
    ```shell
    docker compose exec postgres backups
    ```
1. Restore backup (only from `gzip`)
    ```shell
    docker compose exec postgres restore backup_2023_05_26T12_34_08.sql.gz
    ```
1. Hot clean DB (close all connections)
    ```shell
    docker compose exec postgres restore clean
    ```

## Deploy to production

> Using this modes assumes that the `your-domain.com` is already bound to your server (`A` records are configured) and Traefik container raised in production mode

### Mode 3: when front in SSR mode

1. The Traefik container must be running in `Mode 3` on prod server
1. Rename `.env.production.example` to `.env`
1. Set the project name same as `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` in Traefik `.env`
    ```env
    COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=example
    ```
1. Uncomment `Mode 3` block:
    ```env
    # Mode 3: For production with SSR
    COMPOSE_FILE=production.yml
    DOMAIN=your-domain.com
    ```
1. Change all secure variables
1. Add Sentry DSN and Email settings (optional)
1. Run container with `docker compose build` and `docker compose up -d`

### Mode 4: when front in SPA mode

coming soon...

I made this template for myself, but it's awesom if it helps someone else. The settings are far from ideal, so fell free to make a pull request.
